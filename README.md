# FriendTech_Discord_Integration
Set of scripts to map a dedicated discord to the rooms of the keys you own on friendtech and auto forward messages in both directions through your own discord bot.

The mapping requires you to have nÂ° discord channels to map each channel to a specific room of a key you own on Friend Tech.

***This is the first version and even if it is pretty stable and support filters for avoiding forwarding bots messages etc, it still a v1.  Logs needs to be cleaned and structured and sending or receiving pictures isn't supported yet.**

### Prerequisites

1. This project requires Python 3.11.5 or newer. If you haven't already installed Python, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. A discord account and a server where you have administrative privileges. Consider creating a dedicated new one.
3. A friend tech account and your JWT authorization token
 
## Discord Bot Setup

1. **Create a New Application**:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Click on the "New Application" button. Name your application and click "Create".
   
2. **Set up a Bot**:
   - On the left side panel, click on "Bot".
   - Click "Add Bot" and confirm.
   - Toggle the buttons under the Privileged Intents section.
   
3. **Get Your Bot Token**:
   - Under the "TOKEN" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token. Save this token carefully as it will be used in the `config.py` file.

4. **Invite the Bot to Your Server**:
   - On the left side panel, click on "OAuth2".
   - Under "OAuth2 URL Generator", select "bot" in the scopes section.
   - Choose the desired permissions for your bot (It needs AT LEAST to be able to read messages and send embedded).
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.
   - Make sure the bot has access to the channels (or the whole category) that you will use to map the FT rooms.

## Installation

1. **Git**:
   - If you haven't already installed Git, you can find download and installation instructions on the Git official site.

3. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giovall/FriendTech_Discord_Integration.git
   cd FriendTech_Discord_Integration

 > Tip: Alternativly you can manually download the Repository from github.

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Configuration

1. **sample.env**:
   - Rename sample.env to .env
   - Open the .env file in a text editor and replace PASTE_YOUR_FRIEND_TECH_JWT_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_HERE with your Friend Tech JWT token.
 > **REMEMBER: your JWT token is EXTREMELY confidential as gives access to your Friend Tech account. The script stores it in a .env file that ALWAYS stays on your local machine. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure the .env file is protected adequately**
   - Replace PASTE_YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN with your Discord Bot token you saved earlier.
  
2. **sample.config**:
   - Rename sample.config.py to config.py
   - Open the config.py file in a text editor and replace PASTE_YOUR_FRIEND_TECH_ADDRESS with your Friend Tech wallet address.
  
2. **sample.chat_room_ids**:
   - Rename sample.chat_room_ids.py to chat_room_ids.py
   - Open the chat_room_ids.py file in a text editor and replace the placeholders according to the example provided.
     > Tip: In Discord, enable Developer Mode in Settings to easily copy IDs by right-clicking on channels.

  
     ## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: On startup, the scripts initialize the Discord bot and establish WebSocket connections to the Friend Tech API.
2. **autod.py**: The autod.py script listens for messages on Discord, forwarding any received messages to the corresponding Friend Tech rooms.
3. **listen.py**: Conversely, listen.py monitors for messages from Friend Tech rooms, relaying them back to the appropriate Discord channels.
4. **Running the Scripts**: The run.py script is used to launch both listeners simultaneously, allowing for real-time, two-way communication between platforms.
5. **Secure Closure**: After message transmission, WebSocket connections are responsibly closed, maintaining security.

## Usage

1. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python run.py
